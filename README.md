# Telco customer churn - prediction
ML-final-project

In the final project of our class, we worked on predicting the propensity of customers to churn, leveraging the data of a telecom company utilizing a machine learning (ML) model. Our goal was to find the best suited model to reduce the firmÂ´s attrition rate. We tackled the problem by following a thought-through plan including many predetermined steps - from data exploration and -preparation towards model short-listing and tuning. After testing four systems and interpreting their outcomes, we finally decided to deploy a logistic regression model. In this paper, on one hand, we describe what we did from technical perspective, why we did it, and how we did it. On the other hand, we embedded our work in a sound management context to better frame the business perspective of our ML task. Lastly, we provide a two-faced discussion on both the technical- as well as the business perspective before finally concluding by stating several lessons learned.
